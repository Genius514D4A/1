# OpenWhisk integration with Serverless Framework

The [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. Using a simple manifest file, developers can define serverless functions, connect them to event sources and declare cloud services needed by their application. The framework handles deploying these serverless applications to the cloud providers. It also allows developers to monitor services in production, roll-out updates and assist debugging issues. It also has a vibrant ecosystem of third-party plugins to extend the functionality of the framework. This is where OpenWhisk comes in. 

OpenWhisk has [its own provider plugin for Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-openwhisk). Developers using the Serverless Framework can choose to deploy their applications to any OpenWhisk platform instance (hosted on Bluemix, or other cloud or private). Multi-provider support also means moving applications between platforms is much easier and developers can develop multi-cloud serverless applications.
