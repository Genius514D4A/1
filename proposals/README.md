# Proposal for OpenWhisk EnhanceMents (POEMs)

A Proposal for OpenWhisk EnhanceMent(POEM) is a way to propose, and manage new features/ideas in OpenWhisk.
This directory contains approved proposals. The one who wants to include any major new feature, subsystem, piece of functionality and any breaking changes is supposed to open a proposal.

## Quickstart to propose a new change.
1. Copy the [POEM template](./POEM-N-template.md) and open a pull request.
2. [Create a corresponding issue](/issues/new?template=proposal.md) with the prefix, `[Proposal]` in the title.

## What is considered to open a proposal
Create an issue when you propose:
 * any major new feature, subsystem, or piece of functionality
 * a big change which requires multiple PRs to complete it
 * a breaking change that impacts public interfaces, data structures, or core execution paths. 

If you are not sure, ask to committers or PMCs of OpenWhisk.

We are inspired by KEP(Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), KIP(Kafka Improvement Proposal), and Cordova-discuss.
