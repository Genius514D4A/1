# This playbook deploys a ElasticSearch cluster

- hosts: elasticsearch
  vars:
    #
    # host_group - usually "{{ groups['...'] }}" where '...' is what was used
    #   for 'hosts' above.  The hostname of each host will be looked up in this
    #   group to assign a zero-based index.  That index will be used in concert
    #   with 'name_prefix' below to assign a host/container name.
    host_group: "{{ groups['elasticsearch'] }}"
    #
    # name_prefix - a unique prefix for this set of elasticsearches.  The prefix
    # will be used in combination with an index (determined using
    # 'host_group' above) to name host/elasticsearcher.
    name_prefix: "elasticsearch"
